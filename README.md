# Roku remote script

## intro/backstory

I have a Roku TV for pretty long time and was looking for a way to control my TV
from my PC with linux onboard.

Basically i was able to download android remote app and linux control app on
electron, they also have a web version which allows you to conrol your smart TV
from the browser.

After looking into web version I decided to dig into protocol documentation.
